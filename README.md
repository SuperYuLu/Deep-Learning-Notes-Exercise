# Deep Learnig Notes and Exercise  
My notes on deep learning, from online courses on Coursera and Udacity   

## Deep Learning Courses from Coursera and Udacity  

This course goes more basic, from very fundamental mathmatics and numpy usages, to building simple neural networks. Well be easier if reader has taken Andrew's Coursera class "Machine learning". If one already have fundamentals of mathine learning knowledge (e.g. ISLR), I would recommend go with Udacity path, which is more adavance and has higer learning rate.
