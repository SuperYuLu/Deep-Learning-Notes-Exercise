## Deep Learning Courses: Coursera and Udacity  

To my own knowledge, the Coursera course goes more basic, from very fundamental mathmatics and numpy usages, to building simple neural networks. Well be easier if reader has taken Andrew's Coursera class "Machine learning". If one already have fundamentals of mathine learning knowledge (e.g. ISLR), I would recommend go with Udacity path, which is more adavance and has higer learning rate.
